  // PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE, priority and scheduling are not affected by the mutex

  // PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, value affects a thread's (such as thrd1) priority and
  // scheduling when higher-priority threads block on one or more mutexes owned
  // by thrd1 where those mutexes are initialized with PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT.
  // thrd1 runs with the higher of its priority or the highest priority of any
  // thread waiting on any of the mutexes owned by thrd1.
  // If thrd1 blocks on a mutex owned by another thread, thrd3, the same
  // priority inheritance effect recursively propagates to thrd3. Use
  // PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT to avoid priority inversion. Priority inversion occurs
  // when a low-priority thread holds a lock that a higher-priority thread
  // wants. Because the higher-priority thread cannot continue until the
  // lower-priority thread releases the lock, each thread is treated as if it
  // had the inverse of its intended priority.
  // If the symbol _POSIX_THREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is defined, for a mutex
  // initialized with the protocol attribute value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, the
  // following actions occur in the Solaris Operating Environment when the owner
  // of that mutex dies
  // The behavior on owner death depends on the value of the robustness argument
  // of pthread_mutexattr_setrobust_np().
  // workflow
  // 1) The mutex is unlocked.
  // 2)The next owner of the mutex acquires it with an error return of
  // EOWNERDEAD.
  // The next owner of the mutex should try to make the state protected by the
  // mutex consistentâ€”the state might have been left inconsistent when the
  // previous owner died. If the owner is successful in making the state
  // consistent, call pthread_mutex_init() for the mutex and unlock the mutex.

  // If pthread_mutex_init() is called on a previously initialized,
  // but not yet destroyed mutex, the mutex is not reinitialized.
  // If the owner is unable to make the state consistent, do
  // not call pthread_mutex_init(), but unlock the mutex.In this event,
  // all waiters will be woken up and all subsequent calls to
  // pthread_mutex_lock() will fail to acquire the
  // mutex and return an error code of ENOTRECOVERABLE.You can now
  // make the mutex state consistent by calling
  // pthread_mutex_destroy() to uninitialize the mutex and
  // calling pthread_mutex_init() to reinitialize it.

  // the next owner acquires the lock with an error code of EOWNERDEAD.

  // The next owner of this mutex acquires it with an error return of

  // Your application must check the return code from pthread_mutex_lock() for
  // a mutex of this type.
  // The new owner of this mutex should make the state protected by the mutex
  // consistent; this state might have been left inconsistent when the

  // All waiters are woken up and all subsequent calls to
  // pthread_mutex_lock() fail to acquire the mutex. The return code is
  // ENOTRECOVERABLE. The mutex can be made consistent by calling
  // pthread_mutex_destroy() to uninitialize the mutex, and calling
  // pthread_mutex_int() to reinitialize it.

  // If the owner of a mutex dies, the mutex can become inconsistent.
  // pthread_mutex_consistent_np makes the mutex object, mutex, consistent after
  // the death of its owner.
  // Call pthread_mutex_lock() to acquire the inconsistent mutex. The
  // EOWNWERDEAD return value indicates an inconsistent mutex.
  // Call pthread_mutex_consistent_np() while holding the mutex acquired by a
  // previous call to pthread_mutex_lock().
  // Because the critical section protected by the mutex might have been left in
  // an inconsistent state by the dead owner, make the mutex consistent only if
  // you are able to make the critical section protected by the mutex
  // consistent.
  // Calls to pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_unlock(), and
