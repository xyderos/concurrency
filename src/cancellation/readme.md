# Cancellation

* __Stop the execution of a thread before it completes__

Things to do:

1) __Release locks__
2) __Free memory__

Idea:

* __Cancel based on thread id, at some point soon, the thread will  be cancelled__

A lot of operating systems implement __asynchronous cancellation__

* __kill it__

_The killer assumes that the thread can be safely eliminated, difficult to impossible_

POSIX implements a __cancellation state__ for __each thread__

* __Disable cancellation in critical section__
* __enable it afterwards__

#### __Deffered cancellation__

A thread exits __when it polls the library to find out if it should exit__ or when it is __blocked in a library call that is a cancellation point__

* Poll via __testcancel__ (checks if a bit has been set)
* If there is a pending request, __the function will not return at all and the thread will die__
* Some standard cancellation functions also call that

The thread will run if it is __in critical section__
* __Difficult if you need bounded cancellation times__

_Cancellation points are points in the control flow where the control returns to the scheduler, for example when you invoke a system call, in other words, if ou can influence the scheduling decisions, in other words, __interruptable___

* _When you are about to have a context switch and execute another call, this is a cancellation point_

#### __Cancellation cleanup handlers__

* __Mechanism to cleanup the threads state upon cancellation__
* __Called upon the exiting of the thread__

These handlers are basically __pushed into the threads cleanup stask__, which is basically an entity for us, but in reality its simple entries into the __call stack__

* __These functions will be called whether you cancel or exit__
* If the thread __wont be cancelled__, __pop__ the functions, you __dont need them__

___Always remember to pop after you exit the current scope of the thread (braces)___

__A basic law__

* In section of code that you __allocate resources__, push a __cleanup handler__
* They are responsible to __restore variables, free up memory, etc__
* __All these sections of code must be atomic in order to respect cancellation__
* Then you run __with cancellation allowed__
* Upon completion, the __handler is called__ and the handler shall be popped
* If there are cancellation points within the allocation and deallocation period, __cancellation must be turned off__

#### __Cancellation points__

They are __different from vendor to vendor__ (although there are standard functions that are cancellation points, google them)
* This makes them __not portable__

In general, there are __four cases__ where you need to cancel a thread

1) Kill it __instantly__
2) Kill it in __bounded CPU time__
3) Prevent it from making __global changes__
4) Prevent it from __wasting CPU time__

_4 implies 2, 1 is impossible and best case not well defined, 3 is not meaningful_

Conclusion: __4__

__Time cancellation is not guaranteed in POSIX__
* __Asynchronous__ cancellation will probably occupy it for a couple of ms
* __Deferred__ cancellation will keep you informed at the __synchronization points__

Imagine a log prio thread being asked to cancel from a super high prio thread
* might never get cancelled

* As long as you care about __4__, your thread will cancel in its next scheduled time in __async cancellation__

Deferred cancellation is
1) more or less a __polling scheme__ when the thread is running
2) __async__ when the thread is blocked

Example:

1) T2 is asking T1 to cancel
2) T1 probably has a cancellation point
3) When hit, the thread will be cancelled

Where to put the cancellation point?

* __inside loops!__ eg once every N iterations

### __Cancel sleeping threads__

* Obviously, you need for it to __wake up__ and hit a __cancellation point__

What if we had multiple hits in our example code?

* __Use synchronization!__ eg either a semaphore or a condition variable since waiting is a __cancellation point__

Rules of thumb

* __Never cancel a thread that has called join, you might create a zombie__

* Any cancellation handlers will be run with the mutex held. Youâ€™d better
make sure the mutex gets unlocked if you ever expect to use it again. Only the
owner thread is allowed to unlock a mutex, so, by definition, the unlocking has to
occur in a cleanup handler!

* You dont want to be starting new threads when there are one that are not gone! Either wait for them to join of exit

* In the code snippets, imagine calling again the searches function. There would be some shady stuff happening since no proper cleanup would occur on the global thread array. A barrier might be a solution but there are issues with detaching stuff, use a semaphore!

* Keep in mind that you can toogle on and off cancellation within the program based on the state

At the end of the day, __avoid cancellation unless its explicitly needed__
